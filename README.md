This is my first repository that containsexercises done through my studies journey with python. The exercises are split into diferent folders that contain exercises sorted by different python data types/ functionalities.
--- explanation of basic data types in python
Please find short summary of each module: 1)String- Strings in Python are sequences of characters, enclosed within either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). They are immutable, meaning once created, their contents cannot be changed. Python provides numerous built-in methods to manipulate and work with strings efficiently, such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting. 2)Lists- Lists in Python are ordered collections of items, which can be of any data type, separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). They are mutable, allowing for easy modification of their elements after creation. Lists support various operations like appending, removing, and slicing, making them versatile data structures for storing and manipulating data in Python. 3)Dictionary -Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of key-value pairs, enclosed within curly braces ({ }). They are mutable and versatile, allowing for easy retrieval, insertion, and deletion of elements based on their keys. Dictionaries are commonly used for representing mappings between keys and values, making them useful for tasks like storing settings, organizing data, and representing real-world relationships. 4)Conditional Statements & Lists - Conditional statements and loops in Python are fundamental control structures for decision-making and repetition. Conditional statements, like if, elif, and else, enable the execution of specific code blocks based on given conditions. Loops, including for and while loops, allow for the repeated execution of a block of code until a specified condition is met or for a fixed number of iterations. These constructs are essential for creating flexible and powerful programs that can handle various scenarios and automate repetitive tasks efficiently.
